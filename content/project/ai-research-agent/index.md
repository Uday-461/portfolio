Developed an **AI-powered research assistant** that automates the entire machine learning pipeline generation process for medical researchers who lack extensive technical expertise.

## The Problem

Medical researchers face significant barriers when applying ML:
- **Technical expertise gap**: Limited programming and ML knowledge
- **Time constraints**: Research deadlines vs. ML development time
- **Reproducibility challenges**: Difficult to replicate ML workflows
- **Validation complexity**: Ensuring medical-grade model reliability

## The Solution

Built an intelligent agent that:
1. **Understands research objectives** from natural language descriptions
2. **Generates complete ML pipelines** automatically
3. **Validates models** using medical research standards
4. **Provides explanations** for model decisions and recommendations

```

## Key Features

### 🧠 Natural Language Understanding
Researchers can describe their goals in plain English:
- "Predict patient readmission risk using lab values"
- "Classify tumor types from MRI scans"
- "Identify drug interactions from patient records"

### 🔧 Automated Pipeline Generation
The system automatically:
- **Selects appropriate algorithms** based on data characteristics
- **Performs feature engineering** and preprocessing
- **Optimizes hyperparameters** using Bayesian optimization
- **Validates models** using cross-validation and medical standards

### 🏥 Medical-Grade Validation
- **Statistical significance testing** for model performance
- **Fairness and bias detection** in predictions
- **Clinical relevance assessment** of model outputs
- **Compliance checking** with medical data regulations

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

```python
class MedicalResearchAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.nlp_engine = BioBERTProcessor()
        self.pipeline_generator = AutoMLGenerator()
        self.validator = MedicalModelValidator()
        self.explainer = SHAPExplainer()

    def process_research_request(self, request: str) -> ResearchResult:
        # Parse research objective
        objective = self.nlp_engine.extract_objective(request)

        # Generate ML pipeline
        pipeline = self.pipeline_generator.create_pipeline(objective)

        # Validate for medical use
        validation_results = self.validator.validate(pipeline, objective)

        # Generate explanations
        explanations = self.explainer.explain(pipeline, validation_results)

        return ResearchResult(
            pipeline=pipeline,
            validation=validation_results,
            explanations=explanations
        )
```

### Model Registry
```python
MEDICAL_MODELS = {
    'classification': {
        'risk_prediction': ['RandomForest', 'XGBoost', 'LogisticRegression'],
        'diagnosis': ['SVM', 'NeuralNetwork', 'EnsembleMethods']
    },
    'regression': {
        'outcome_prediction': ['LinearRegression', 'GradientBoosting', 'RandomForest'],
        'time_series': ['LSTM', 'ARIMA', 'Prophet']
    },
    'clustering': {
        'patient_segmentation': ['KMeans', 'DBSCAN', 'Hierarchical']
    }
}
```
